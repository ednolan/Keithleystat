###Installation:
####Software that you need to have installed to use the ardustat:
- FTDI Drivers / Arduino Uno Drivers, depending on which version of arduino you are using (see [Getting Started guide for 
arduino] (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)).
- [Python 2] (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/)
- [Node.JS] (http://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) (See Quickstart guide for installation [here] (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart))
<br>Note: If you use Windows, you should install MongoDB as a Windows service.
- [AVRDUDE] (http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/)
<br>Note: If you use Windows, you can install AVRDUDE by installing [WinAVR] (http://winavr.sourceforge.net/download.html)
- If you use Mac OS X, you will also need to install [XCode] (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). After that, all software except for the arduino drivers can be installed automatically by running the Ardustat Installer app (be sure to enter your password if prompted by the terminal).
- If you use Windows, you'll also need to install [Visual C++ 2010] (http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express) so that Node.JS can compile the libraries correctly.

Note: This software is not tested with Internet Explorer or older versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc. To avoid unpredictable results, please use a modern browser.
	
###Instructions for first run:
1. Depending on your operating system:
<br> Mac OS X: Double click on the "Ardustat" application
<br> Linux: Execute the bash script startArdustat.sh
<br> Windows: Go to the Software folder, execute installLibs.bat, execute updatePATH.bat, and execute: node expressserver.js COM4 (replace COM4 with your arduino's actual COM port, which you can check by going to Start/Devices and Printers)
2. In a browser, go to http://localhost:8888/debug
	(stuff should be happening)
3. Upload the firmware by clicking the button marked "Upload Firmware"
4. Give your ardustat an id: in the "Set ID" box type an ID number between 0 and 240, and hit send (you only have to do this once as well, the id will persist in EEPROM)
5. We now need to calibrate the ardustat.  Put a quality resistor of known value between the working and counter clips, and then attach the reference clip to the counter clip
6. Under calibration resistor value, enter the value of your resistor in ohms, and hit send. You should see the graph changing, the yellow line should slope downwards and then reset 3 times. 
7. Your ardustat is now calibrated.  You won't have to do this again (unless you delete the calibration file or feel that the values were inaccurate). 
8. Go to http://localhost:8888/. You should now see the Potential and Current trace. Play with the the potentiostat and galvanostat settings.

From here on out, all you need to do is:
<br> Mac OS X: Double click on the "Ardustat" application
<br> Linux: Execute the bash script startArdustat.sh
<br> Windows: go to the Software folder and execute: node expressserver.js COM4 (replace COM4 with your arduino's actual COM port, which you can check by going to Start/Devices and Printers)
Then go to http://localhost:8888/

##Instructions for regular use:
- For basic manual control, go to localhost:8888/.
- For cycling, go to localhost:8888/cycler.
- For cyclic voltometry, go to localhost:8888/cv.
- To recalibrate the Ardustat or give it a new ID, go to localhost:8888/debug.
- To view the MongoDB logs, go to localhost:8888/getlogs.
